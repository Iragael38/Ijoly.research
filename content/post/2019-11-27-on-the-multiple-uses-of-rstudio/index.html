<p>Trying to list the courses I have on the work, it appears that everything turns around R &amp; RStudio. Is it a behavioral bias, a conviction or true ability of the softwares?</p>
<div id="document-editing" class="section level1">
<h1>Document editing</h1>
<div id="dynamic-document" class="section level2">
<h2>Dynamic document</h2>
<p>Rmarkdown and Knitr have open the way to write so many types of documents. Report, article, slides presentation, webpage, book.</p>
<p>Writing these documents is now dynamic, in the sense that, only the writing is manual activity. Formating the document, listing the bibliographic references, inserting image, drawing figure, building table, summarysing data, are all automated actions.</p>
<p>This imply that you precise in the document the image you want to insert, but you do not insert the image by hand (copying and pasting). You establish a permanent link between the document and its inputs. Changing an input (for ex. after correction of a graphic) will update the document.</p>
<p>My research presentations and lesson supports are now performed (95%) with Rmarkdown and/or Knitr.</p>

<div id="interactive-documents" class="section level2">
<h2>Interactive documents</h2>
<p>I name <em>interactive documents</em>, documents which propose interaction with readers, like button, selection, etc.
Simple versions are the webpages that offer dynamic reading, with multiple tabs.</p>
<p>Dashboard and App are accessible through <code>Flexdashboard</code> and <code>Shiny</code> offering advanced interactions.</p>

<div id="office-documents" class="section level2">
<h2>Office documents</h2>

Excel files reading can be performed using <code>readxl</code> <code>openxlsx</code> and Excel writing with <code>openxlsx</code> (not only exporting table in xls format - writing in specific cells and printing figure in sheet, formating tables) with <code>xltabr</code></li>
</ul>
