# A Bookdown Reminder


## Publish on GitHub

- The git tab won't appear until you are in a project with a git repo. You can add a git repro to your project via Tools -> Project Options -> Git/SVN


One approach is to publish your book as a GitHub Pages site from a /docs folder on your master branch as described in GitHub Help. First, set the output directory of your book to be /docs by adding the line output_dir: "docs" to the configuration file _bookdown.yml. Then, after pushing your changes to GitHub, go to your repository’s settings and under “GitHub Pages” change the “Source” to be “master branch /docs folder”. In this case, the .nojekyll file has to be in the /docs folder.

- add `output_dir: "docs"` in the configuration file `_bookdown.yml`
- the repo have to be public
- after pushing your changes to GitHub, go to your repository's settings and under "GitHub Pages" change the "Source" to be "master branch /docs folder".

## Build the book


```
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::gitbook")
bookdown::render_book("index.Rmd", "bookdown::pdf_book")
```

## Remarks

### Managing Several Files

By default, bookdown merges all Rmd files by the order of filenames, e.g., `01-intro.Rmd` will appear before `02-literature.Rmd`. Filenames that start with an underscore `_` are skipped. If there exists an Rmd file named `index.Rmd`, it will always be treated as the first file when merging all Rmd files.

You can use a field named `rmd_files` to define your own list and order of Rmd files for the book. For example,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmd_files: ["index.Rmd", "abstract.Rmd", "intro.Rmd"]
```

In this case, bookdown will just use whatever you defined in this YAML field without any special treatments of `index.Rmd`` or underscores. If you want both HTML and LaTeX/PDF output from the book, and use different Rmd files for HTML and LaTeX output, you may specify these files for the two output formats separately, e.g.,

```{r, eval=FALSE}
rmd_files:
  html: ["index.Rmd", "abstract.Rmd", "intro.Rmd"]
latex: ["abstract.Rmd", "intro.Rmd"]
```


### Keeping in cache a chunk results

` \```{r important-computing, cache=TRUE} `

### Special headers

There are a few special types of first-level headers that will be processed differently in bookdown. The first type is an unnumbered header that starts with the token (PART)

```{r}
# (PART) Part I {-} 

# Chapter One

# Chapter Two

# (PART) Part II {-} 

# Chapter Three 
```

You can use (PART\*) (the backslash before * is required) instead of (PART) if a part title should not be numbered.


The second type is an unnumbered header that starts with (APPENDIX), indicating that all chapters after this header are appendices, e.g.,
```{r}
# Chapter Two

# (APPENDIX) Appendix {-} 

# Appendix A
```


### Text references


```{r, eval=FALSE}
A normal paragraph.

(ref:foo) A scatterplot of the data `cars` using **base** R graphics. 

```{r foo, fig.cap='(ref:foo)'}
plot(cars)  # a scatterplot
```

### Figures

```{r, eval=FALSE}}
knitr::include_graphics(rep("images/knit-logo.png", 3))
```


### Custom Blocks

You can generate custom blocks using the block engine in knitr, i.e., the chunk option `engine = 'block'`, or the more compact syntax ` \```{block} `.


```
```{block, type='FOO'}
Some text for this block.
```
```

For example, we may save the following style in a CSS file, say, `style.css`:

```
div.FOO {
  font-weight: bold;
  color: red;
}
```

And the YAML metadata of the R Markdown document can be:

```
---
output:
  bookdown::html_book:
    includes:
      in_header: style.css
---
```



there is an alternative engine named block2 that supports arbitrary Markdown syntax, e.g.,

```
```{block2, type='FOO'}
Some text for this block [@citation-key].

- a list item
- another item

More text.
```
```

### HTML widgets

Both webshot and PhantomJS can be installed automatically from R:

```
install.packages("webshot")
webshot::install_phantomjs()
```

For example: a table created from the DT package (Xie, Cheng, and Tan 2019):
```
DT::datatable(iris)
```

Below is a Shiny app example (Figure 2.6):

```
knitr::include_app("https://yihui.shinyapps.io/miniUI/", 
  height = "600px")
```


### International langages

For non-LaTeX output, you can set the language field in the configuration file `_bookdown.yml`. Currently the default settings are:

```
language:
  label:
    fig: 'Figure '
    tab: 'Table '
    eq: 'Equation '
    thm: 'Theorem '
    lem: 'Lemma '
    cor: 'Corollary '
    prp: 'Proposition '
    cnj: 'Conjecture '
    def: 'Definition '
    exm: 'Example '
    exr: 'Exercise '
    proof: 'Proof. '
    remark: 'Remark. '
    solution: 'Solution. '
  ui:
    edit: Edit
    chapter_name: ''
    appendix_name: ''
```
